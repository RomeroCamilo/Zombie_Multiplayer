Game: Zombie Multiplayer Game

Description: I have designed a simple multiplayer game where one person plays with one set of keybindings and the other with another set.
One player plays as the role of a zombie who will chase the other player who plays as a human. The human must avoid collision with the zombie, and if there is collision, the game ends.

Functionality added:

-Collision detection function for when player1 sprite collides with player2 sprite. I tried different collision measurements until i got to something that works fairly.

-Collision detection for when the player's tries to go out of bound with the screen was added.

-Two sprites are drawn onto the screen. A Human sprite and a zombie sprite.

-Replaced hard coded speed with variables to provide easier reading and modifations of speed of the player movements.

-Extra detection for when keyboard detection of what key got pressed. Depending on the set of keys that got pressed, a specific sprite will move. In this case, awsd keys are for the zombie player, and the arrow keys are for the human player.

-  Collision handling function. This function will execute after collision detection function. From here, a new background screen will be drawn displaying 'Game Over'. This is a png image. I then use the thread library and chrono library, that will sleep the program for 2 seconds, and then the program ends, therefore ending the game.
